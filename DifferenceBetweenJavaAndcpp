1. All the memory in Java is dynamically allocated
2. There is a garbage collection system
   No need to consider memory leak
3. Java use singleton as global variable
   Singleton is a kind of special class which just contains static method and static variable,
   indicating that there is no instance (just one instance which is called by the class name).
4. Java doesn't use macros, no #define
5. Java has no headfile, it uses package instead
6. Java has total control on the pointers
7. In Java, the compiler doesn't directly compile the java language into machine code. Instead,
   it translate the code into a kind of .class file, which is run on JVM. It's not so efficient,
   but very convenient since the .class file can be run on the different platforms without 
   compiling again.
