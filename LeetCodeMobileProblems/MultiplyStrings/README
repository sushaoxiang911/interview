Given two numbers represented as strings, return multiplication of the numbers as a string.

Note: The numbers can be arbitrarily large and are non-negative.


利用竖式的思想，进行乘法运算。

        3    4

*      1    3

——————

       9      12

3     4

——————

3     13     12


再处理进位：

3 13 12 - > 3 14 2 -> 4 4 2
