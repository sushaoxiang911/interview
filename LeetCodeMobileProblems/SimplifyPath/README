 Given an absolute path for a file (Unix-style), simplify it.

For example,
path = "/home/", => "/home"
path = "/a/./b/../../c/", => "/c"
Corner Cases:

    Did you consider the case where path = "/../"?
    In this case, you should return "/".
    Another corner case is the path might contain multiple slashes '/' together, such as "/home//foo/".
    In this case, you should ignore redundant slashes and return "/home/foo".


模拟整个过程：

1. "/" 根目录

2. ".." 跳转上级目录，上级目录为空，所以依旧处于 "/"

3. "a" 进入子目录a，目前处于 "/a"

4. "b" 进入子目录b，目前处于 "/a/b"

5. "c" 进入子目录c，目前处于 "/a/b/c"

6. "." 当前目录，不操作，仍处于 "/a/b/c"

7. ".." 返回上级目录，最终为 "/a/b"
