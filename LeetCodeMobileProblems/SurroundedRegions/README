ven a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.

A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region .

For example,

X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X

After running your function, the board should be:

X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X


analyze the problem

if there is a O on the boarder that is the O that should not be taken
and we expand from this O to every O and mark them
That should be still O and other O should be X
