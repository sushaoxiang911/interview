giving a tree, find all the neighbor nodes
e.g.
     1
    / \
   2   3
  /\   /\
 4  5  6 7

the first level: no neighbor pair 
    second      2 and 3 are neighbor
    third       4 and 5 are neighbor pair 
                5 and 6 are neighbor pair
                6 and 7 are neighbor pair
    use pointers to connect the neighbor pair nodes:

First way: level order traversal(method is ignored)
Second way: every node's left child and right child are neighbor
            and the right child and the right child of the neighbors are neighbors
