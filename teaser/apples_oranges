Given three baskets, one of which is filled with apples, another one is filled with oranges,
and the last one is filled with mixing of apples and oranges.
We have tree labels to mark those tree baskets, but occationally, ALL of them are on the 
wrong place. You are allowed to pick just one fruit and determine the right place of
the tree labels

Grab from the one labeled with "mix"
if it is an apple then this former "mix" is actually "apple"
and the other two must be mix and orange
the former "orange" will be "mix" and the former "apple" will be "orange"
