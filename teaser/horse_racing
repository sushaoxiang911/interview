25 horses, 5 racing lane(everytime we can have 5 horses racing together)
how to find the first three in seven racing?

divide into 5 groups, find the first of five groups -> 5 times
race these five first's, gets the ranking of these 5 -> 1 time, here we know which is the first one
we take the second and third of the first group, the first and the second of the second group and the first of the third group.
The first and the second is the second and the third -> 1 time.

7 times
